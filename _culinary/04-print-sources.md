I haven't lived on this Earth long enough to say what the best cookbooks are; there are simply too many! You could take a *Julie & Julia* approach and just cook every damn recipe in a book  to figure out which ones you like and which ones you don't like. Or you can make your decisions based on legacy alone and, sticking with the Julia Child theme, commit to "Mastering the Art of French Cooking," where you can spend time deboning your very own duck, among many other over the top practices. The newest, trendiest cookbooks also arean't always the best way to go, as they may become old news before you even have the chance to use them.

What I provide below are a handul of cookbooks falling into three cataegories: general use, savory, and desserts. These are just the cookbooks that I've had personal experience with and are certaintly not the only ones I have used and will use in the future. I hope to regularly build on this library as I continue to explore.



### Kenji Lopez-Alt's ["The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393081087/?tag=serieats-20)
As the book's title suggests, this book takes an experimental approach to cooking. As a self-procliamed "culinary nerd," Lopez-Alt flips many of te conventional cooking technqiues and recipes on their heads, providing his more scientifically founded methods. Similarly to Alton Brown, he takes concepts from Physics, Chemistry, and Biology and applies them to optimally roasting chicken and painlessly chopping onions. What seperates this book from others preaching "modern cooking" is that Lopez-Alt provides emperical data and figrues to support his findings. This takes it to a level that's probably overkill for most home-cooks, but is a large part why I find this book so compelling. 

Most of his recipes are online, but the pictures and graphs are only found in the print version. This book, in conjunction with his online video tutorials, will make you a more intelligent home-cook who works with intention in the kitchen. 

### Mark Bitman's ["How to Cook Everything"](https://www.amazon.com/How-Cook-Everything-Recipes-Anniversary/dp/0764578650)
If you want a more classical perspective, this book as extensive as it gets. As the title suggest, the whopping __ page culinary epic provides recipes ranging from __ to __ , touching on everything in between. It's a bookshelf staple with a strong reputation and as wide a variety as one could ask for. 

### Sarabeth 's ["Sarabeth's Bakery: "]()
My dad was gifted this book for his birthday a decade ago and it is stillt he first place he looks when he is tasked desert for a dinner party or has the baking bug on a sunday afternoon.
