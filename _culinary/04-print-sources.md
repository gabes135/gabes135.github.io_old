Or you can make your decisions based on legacy and, sticking with the Julia Child theme, commit to "Mastering the Art of French Cooking," where you can spend time deboning your very own duck, among many other over the top practices. The newest, trendiest cookbooks also arean't always the best way to go, as they may become old news before you even have the chance to use them.

What I provide below are a handul of cookbooks falling into three cataegories: general use, savory, and desserts. These are just the cookbooks that I've had personal experience with and are certaintly not the only ones I have used and will use in the future. I hope to regularly build on this library as I continue to explore.
