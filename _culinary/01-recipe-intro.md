It is a difficult task to identify a "good" recipe. First, what does it mean for a recipe to be "good?" That is very much up to the individual and can widely vary. However, I do believe that there are universal guidelines that should be considered when searching for recipes. When leafing through a cookbook or browsing a food publication website, these are the things I'm looking for:

## Source Reputation
It's often easy to identify the reputability of a recipe source. A personal blog (much like this one...) is likely gonna be less reliable than a decades old cooking publication. A recipe from a cookbook published 50 years ago may be less up-to-date than one published in the last 10 years, especially with the relatively recent change in way we shop for, prepare, and eat food (local, farm-to-table, etc.). With this in mind, what sources are trustworthy becomes apparent. 

This is not to say that personal blogs or age-old recipes are bad, in fact they can many times be just as good, if not better than their more popular counterparts. But in general, this is what I am looking for in a recipe source.

## Ingredients
The ingredients called for in a dish are also strong identifiers of the recipe's quality. As a rule of thumb, any recipe than calls for Velveeta cheese, Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup, or any similarly ultra-processed foods should be ruled out. If you happen to like processed foods, then by all means go for it. But often times, ingredients like these can be replaced by healthier ones that just take a little more prep work to produce, which tells me that the recipe writer cares about what is going into the dish. 

On the other side of the spectrum, if a recipe is calling for ingredients that are out of your price range, it also may not be the best choice. The recipe itself is probably delicious, but I'd be shocked to hear from a professional chef that expensive ingredients are what make their dishes taste good. I think that the recipes you should be looking to recreate should call for ingredients that are *realistic* for your budget, but also get your excited about making the dish when you pick them out at the grocery store.

## Recipe Complexity
Recipes with a million steps have their place. If you are making croissants from scratch or risott, then definitely don't choose the recipe with the fewest amount of steps. More complex recipes require more work and often times produce a more tasty, and equally complex tasting dish. They do have their time and place, but just because a recipe has a million moving parts, does not mean it is going to come out of the oven or off the stove and without a doubt taste great. Before you dive into a recipe, a great question to ask yourself is "is this going to be worth it?"

For example, there are tons of bread recipes that involve days of prep work to produce a single loaf. If you are a beginning bread baker, choosing the most complex recipe will result in almost a guarantee failure. And even if you're an accomplished bread baker, the process with likely be a challenge. Instead, focus on finding more home-baker friendly recipes like Jim Lahey's (No-Knead Bread)(https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread). Recipes with their own complexities, but that bring stress into your life, are what I look for.

## The Small Things
The last feature I look for in a recipe are the less significant choices that writer made when producing the recipe, sucha as:
* Using weight (and the metric system) rather than volume for baking
* Emphasizing seasoning and encouraging tasting
* Including ingredients that balance (like acid for rich dishes or salt for sweet dishes)
* Stressing the importance of the ingredient quality

Things like these are in some part personal preferences, but are more importantly factors that I've picked up on from recipes, cooking shows, and articles. As you work through more and more recipes, you will notice commonalities like these and start to look for them in other recipes.
