With Tasty videos and home-made Youtube tutorials overwhelming every social media feed, it may seem hard to identify what recipes you can really trust. I definitely struggle with this as well, but believe to have found a solid group of resources that provide recipes that are **tested**, **modern/scientific**, **relatively easy**, and, mostly importantly, **delicious**. Here are some of my go-to's.

## Online Resources
My parents, among most people who didn't grow up in the age of the internet, have shelves upon shelves of cookbooks dating back decades. Hard cover cookbooks with tattered binding and spilt-on pages will never lose their place in the kitchen, but with every imagineable recipe available online, the internet is the most valuable recipe resource there is. Below are sites that I enjoy using the most.

### [Bon Appétit](https://www.bonappetit.com/)

The first google search I make when contemplating making new dish is "bon appetit {new dish}." Their print magazine has been around since the 1950's and their library online content is just as robust. As I assume is similar with many cooking publications, the food editors at Bon Appétit put tons of time and effort into their recipe development and testing. 

Not only is their website loaded with modern, creative, and seasonal recipes, but they also pour tons of effort into their video tutorials. Many of their most popular recipes are recreated on camera by the editors who developed them, which makes reproducing them at home that much easier. 


### [New York Times Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/)

Similarly to Bon Appétit, the New York Times cooking section has been in publishing for decades and contains recipes for nearly every dish you could think of. What the New York Times has over a smaller publicaiton like Bon Appétit is that they have a much larger network of recipe contibuters. This gives the best overall perspective on a given recipe or cooking technique. On the other hand, with a less concentrated writer base, you can find a larger variation in the culinary choices represented in their recipes. I often confer with bost sources when researching a new recipe.   

### [Alton Brown's Show *Good Eats*](https://altonbrown.com/altonblog/recipes/)

*Good Eats* was the first Food Network program that got me hooked on cooking television. It's blend of science and cooking spoke to me at a young age, changing my perspective on what defines quality cooking. If you are looking for though-out explanations with experimental backing, rather than "it's just the way its always been done," Alton Brown's recipes and techniques are where you should look. His show his quarky and dramatic, which is not for everyone, but his methodology is sound and he isn't afraid to adapt and edit what he got wrong (see *Good Eats: Reloaded*). 

Alton's Brown's recipes won't be as flashy or new-age as those from a more user-base concerned publication like the ones above, but they will be science-backed, not overly complicated, and fairly easy to reproduce in any home kitchen. His site is my go-to for baseline cooking techniques and methods.
