With Tasty videos and home-made Youtube tutorials overwhelming every social media feed, it may seem hard to identify what recipes you can really trust. I definitely struggle with this as well, but believe to have found a solid group of resources that provide recipes that are **tested**, **modern/scientific**, **relatively easy**, and, mostly importantly, **delicious**. Here are some of my go-to's.

## Online Resources
My parents, among most people who didn't grow up in the age of the internet, have shelves upon shelves of cookbooks dating back decades. Hard cover cookbooks with tattered binding and spilt-on pages will never lose their place in the kitchen, but with every imagineable recipe available online, the internet is the most valuable recipe resource there is. Below are sites that I enjoy using the most.

### [Bon Appétit](https://www.bonappetit.com/)

The first google search I make when contemplating making new dish is "bon appetit {new dish}." Their print magazine has been around since the 1950's and their library online content is just as robust. As I assume is similar with many cooking publications, the food editors at Bon Appétit put tons of time and effort into their recipe development and testing. 

Not only is their website loaded with modern, creative, and seasonal recipes, but they also pour tons of effort into their video tutorials. Many of their most popular recipes are recreated on camera by the editors who developed them, which makes reproducing them at home that much easier.
