# Pitching Trajectory Mapping Using MLB Statcast Data
Starting in 2006, a handful Major League Baseball teams implemented the advanced camera system "PITCHf/x" into their stadiums. The camera systems allowed detailed pitch speed, spin rate, and spin direction data to be tracked and analyzedin real time. Since its debut, pitch tracking technology has expanded to all stadiums and the advanced stats they provide have nearly become household names. 

From a Physicist's perspective, the availability of this data presented an oppurtunity to dissect the highlight pitches that seem to defy the laws of gravity. Using just the initial conditions of a given pitch, it's complete trajectory, from when it leaves the pitcher's hand to when it hits the catcher's mitt, can be derived, plotted, and analyzed. 

The three dominating forces that play into the motion of a pitch are 
* Force of Gravity
* Drag Force
* Magnus Force
The force of gravity and the drag force are fairly intuitive; gravity on the baseball always acts down towards the ground and the drag force on the baseball always acts in the opposite direction as the pitches velocity (ie. the direction it is moving in). The magnus force, however, is the seemingly unpredictable, Physics defying force that creates the wild movement seenm, for example, in the pitch below.
