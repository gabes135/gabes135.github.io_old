My favorite use of this tool is to look at some of the MLB's "nastiest" pitches, as identified by the website [Pitcher List](https://www.pitcherlist.com/category/gifs/nastiest-pitches/). Pitch nastiness is a subjective term, but I like to think of it as a measure of how much a pitch makes you scratch your head and think "how on Earth would anyone be able to hit a ball moving like that??"
