The term "pitch tunnelling" refers to a pitcher's ability to mask what type of pitch he is throwing by lining up their trajectories for as long as possible. The best way to explain what this means is using a video of two overlayed, "tunnelled" pitches:

</p>

In this example, Shane Bieber throws both his Fastball and Curveball with similar release points, but at an arm slot that allows them to seamingly stay along the same path for much of their flight. Right when its too late for the batter to realize the pitch is indeed a Fastball headed for the outside corner, instead of a Curveball dropping out of the strike zone, the two pitch trajectories split off from one another. This is pitch tunnelling at its most effective.

The two videos below recreate the overlayed video above using mapped pitch trajectories. From the side angle, you can really see how two trajectories lay atop one another until they ar eabout 20 feet from home plate.
