I'm a Graduate Student in the Physics Department at the Boston Univeristy. After graduating from UC Berkeley Gradaute with a degree in Physics, I worked at the Space Science Laboratory in Berkeley, California for a year. My research there focused on data analysis for the [Van Allen Probes Mission](http://vanallenprobes.jhuapl.edu/).

## Interests
I'm an avid Bay Area sports fan (go Giants and Warriors!) and am particularly interested in the growing field of advanced analytics in sports. For more on this, check out my work on [pitch trajectories]({% link _pages/pitches-intro.md %}).

I'm also a homebaker who has fully dove into the world of sourdough bread. Some of my favorite bakes are documented [here]({% link/bread %}).
