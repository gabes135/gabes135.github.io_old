I'm a UC Berkeley Gradaute with a degree in Physics. I am currently working at the Space Science Laboratory in Berkeley, California as a Student Assistant, focusing on data analysis for the [Van Allen Probes Mission](http://vanallenprobes.jhuapl.edu/).

## Interests
I'm an avid Bay Area sports fan, following the San Francisco Giants and Golden State Warriors religiously. I play Fantasy Baseball and have a strong interest in Sabermetrics and the growing field of advanced analytics in sports. For more on this, check out my work on [pitch trajectories]({% link _pages/pitches-intro.md %}).

I'm a homebaker with a ambition for baking bread. Watching the Food Network at a young age sparked my interest in the culinary arts, and since then I've drawn inspiration from Bon Appetite magazine, Alton Brown and his show *Good Eats*, and the book "Flour Salt Water Yeast" by Ken Forkish. Some of pictures and recipes can be found [here]({% link _pages/culinary-intro.md %})
